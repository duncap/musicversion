Thanks to SirBob_ for the original document.
(YOUR NAME WILL BE TRACKED IF YOU SUGGEST AN EDIT)
Special thanks to Eyoshi, TradingSardGame, AdventureMase, and everyone else who helped with this.
July 29th 2023 (Day 1)
-Giolaboman uploads Peaches MAP. It includes many strange glitches, with an ID for 878258406.
-ID 878258406 leads to a project titled i̷͈̦̰͊͊͝n̵͉̝͙̉i̷̯̔t̵̡̘̻̔į̸̗͝ą̷͉͖̻͌ť̶͕̮̣̹̌̿e̷̻͎̔̚͝.sb3 (initiate.sb3 if you can’t read through the glitchy text) by LaboLog_
-This project features H3X-. He says that the website has been ruined by animators exploiting trending. He says that there are 7 days left until initiation. (The project was taken down by Scratch after being reported by someone.)
-H3X- follows by showing a compressed list of users on Scratch. These users are: Giolaboman, awesomeal82, AlexStudiosinc, Paralyzed_Potato, IncognitoOrange, -JoshyLeKing-, MaciTheGamerYT, Untitled_TV, and hermandise345. (hermandise345, as it seems right now, isn’t actually associated with the ARG, though. This will be updated if it is found that he is.)
-The user H3X- is linked in the notes and credits. The user has a solid black PFP and has nothing on their profile.
-A studio named Untitled Studio is created by Giolaboman. Inside the studio are numerous projects that have been shared that include a similar glitch and ID thing that the peaches MAP had.
-The studio does not feature the same list of people as it was in the Initiate project. Some people are new. These people include GoldenLegends, YeetachuAnimation, and BrickPlex.
-Joe Biden.
  

-Eventually, the initiate project gets mass reported and taken down by the ST.
August 1st 2023 (Day 4)
-Giolaboman (Gio) shares a project titled [INTERRUPTION]. It has a mysterious glitchy thumbnail.
-The project features awesomeal82 (Al) fall out of a portal alongside an unknown character that looks like a samurai.
-The glitch appears, and Al questions if it's the Youtube Shorts ARG glitch.
-The glitch takes the samurai character and Al believes things will not end well.
-Al DMs multiple people in his Discord server, The Target Balls. He sends a contract asking for the receiver to sign to be in his animations.
-Al talks strangely with proper grammar and unironic/non-humorous use of emojis.
-Fine print on the contract says that the signer will become his puppet.
-There were conversations in DMs that according to the people they were sent to, they can't talk about.

Image of the contract sent to Eyoshi:
  
  










August 2nd 2023 (Day 5)
-Moving over to Discord now. Al on his server, The Target Balls, announces a QNA + game night event happening on the 4th. He says that there will be some big Scratchers there.
-Al mentions in someone's DMs that people will "never stop talking about the creature announcement......."
-Al also mentions that the contract sent to many people a day prior is for an animation he is making, which is odd considering he left Scratch.
-Al uploads a short onto Youtube. It features Al sitting on a couch. He sits there completely still, until a glitch similar to the one in the Peaches MAP appears in the background.
-Many in the comments section think this is part of the Youtube Shorts ARG, but Al responds with something along the lines of "not quite!"
August 4th 2023 (Day 6) (Scratch QNA)
-Al begins the event in a new stage channel. Joining him are Gio, and IncognitoOrange. (I forgot who else) They begin to ask for questions, though many don't get asked and it ends up mostly being goofing around.
-Al moves over to games and all of us in the Stage start playing Mario Vs. Luigi Online, Smash Karts, and Gartic Phone.
-Al then has everyone leave the VC and puts everyone in the audience. He begins to showcase his new game named Creatures: Sulselec.
-Al shows off many things, including an appearance of Chirpy created by The_Updator. However, he is stopped in his tracks when another Al shoots Al in the leg. The stream stops and Al leaves the stage, leaving everyone alone in the audience.
-People move over to the normal VC channels. Gio appears and begins to move around back and forth between the various VC channels. We all try to follow.
-Eventually Gio stays in one VC. He says that a mysterious project popped up on his profile and that he can't unshare it. This refers to the [INTERRUPTION] project.
-Al returns to the server saying he has gotten rid of the problem. People quickly take notice that something is off about him.
-Compared to how Al typed previously, Al would now type with full proper grammar, and use emojis he has never used before unironically. 
-After a few people (including me) get muted for saying the words Chirpy and Reverie by the automod, Al says that he will fix the server.
-After working with Eyoshi to get muting and chat filters to work in all channels, Al leaves, but continues to act very nice.
-Al opens his Scratch comments for the first time in many months.
-Al begins talking in the QNA chat (now called Meal). Me and Eyoshi begin to question him about him being a clone. He sends some strange messages that are instantly edited to something nicer. I don't quite remember what they said, but it was something like "just dont say it and you'll be fine" around those lines.
-Later on, Gio joins the VC in his server (Giolaboman Committee). He is working on recording his video about his Spider Man LEGO animation.
-Al joins the VC and begins to help Gio. Al is noticeably more bubbly and happy than he was just a few hours ago in the event stage channel in the Target Balls.
-Al leaves shortly after, with Gio finishing his recording, leaving Dinoteen and I to mess around with Blender for an hour more.
August 5th 2023 (Day 7) (Operation Replace initiated)
-IncognitoOrange (Fanta) announces a new upload on Scratch to his server (Fanta's Basement).
-The project is titled minecrap!!!01101000 01100101 01101100 01110000.
-The binary in the title translates to "help."
-The project features Fanta in a Minecraft world with Creeper? Aww Man by CaptainSparklez playing.
-As you'd expect, a creeper shows up and threatens to blow up Fanta. However, the song suddenly starts to glitch out.
-The ARG glitch appears on the screen, and -JoshyLeKing- (Joshy) appears in a black void; the song stops.
-He says that this isn't angry birds, and the normal animation continues in the background as he talks. The creeper explodes, and Joshy gets thrown back.
-Fanta gets taken into the ARG glitch.
-Joshy begins to act much different to the way he usually does on his Scratch profile comments.
-At the end, a darkened image of a QR code appears. Scanning it will take you to https://sites.google.com/view/scratchvpn/home (which now sadly doesn't work)
-This is BetterScratch. A supposed extension meant to make Scratch much better.
-A button on the page takes you to contributors, with a list of the same Scratchers appearing. Again, this list is slightly different, with BucketsNotAvailable now appearing.
-The BetterScratch logo is the shape that makes up the ARG glitches.
-In Fanta's Basement, Fanta sends some messages.
-His first message "wat a cute boi!!!01101111 01101011 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100001 01110100 00011001 01110011 00100000 01110010 01100101 01100001 01101100 01101100 01111001 00100000 01100011 01110101 01110100 01100101" has binary. It translates to "ok thats really cute" in response to a picture of a cat.
-Another message "what happened to my comment 💀mpm if tujmm epfto'u lopx" has encoded letters. They translate to "lol he still doesn't know"
-Another message "dbo zpv ifbs nf gsff nf qmfbtf mfu nf pvu pg ifsf" translates to "can you hear me free me please let me out of here"
-Fanta remarks to this, saying that his phone is haunted after I translate one of the messages. ("xbju if ifbse nf" to "wait he hears me" (responding to my decoding of the binary)
-I make 2 charts for decoding that could be helpful.
-Al shares his first Scratch in over a month titled Bad Idea Idea.
-Al has a modified design with thicker outlines, bigger eyes, and more saturated hair.
-In the project, he talks about how he will post his bad ideas in the comments so hopefully someone else can pick it up and make it a good idea.
-Hovering over the top of the project causes Al to remark about his redesign. Two options appear.
-Pressing "I like it" causes him to talk normally.
-Pressing "I do not" causes him to instantly disappear. I'm not quite sure if anything happens afterwards.
-Stopping the project has Al ask the viewer why you stopped the project since it wasn't done.
-Stopping the project while Al is leaving after pressing "I like it" will cause him to ask you why you stopped the project while he was leaving. He then goes a little crazy, saying that the viewer thinks they're in charge, and that they can keep Al there. He goes up to the camera creepily and says "No you can't."
-Pressing the green flag in the introductory sections of the project has Al leave to the left. ARG glitch sounds can be heard.
-Pressing the green flag again has Al ask if this is a joke. Al will say to click the flag again. Doing so has him disappear.
-Looking inside the project causes Al to react to this, saying you shouldn't be there.
-Throughout the project, the audio occasionally has the in-built Robot effect applied to it for tiny amounts of time each.
-ADoctorPickle (Pickle) shares a project on Scratch titled Update Project!!!!01010011 01101111 01110011. The binary translates to "Sos"
-The Notes and Credit includes 01010011 01110100 01100001 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100000 01101111 01100110 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110010 00100000 01110111ay, which translates to "Stay out of our way"
-The project features Pickle get consumed by the ARG glitch.
-Pickle responds to a comment on the project saying "Thank you! ADoct- I love it when humans appreciate my work. :)," which is quite out of the ordinary considering he refers to regular people as humans.
-Pickle denies getting pulled away into the ARG glitch in the project after someone in the comments asks.
-Gio comments saying "NO NOT YOU TOO." Gio certainly knows these people are being replaced, and perhaps has commented on the other projects like this.
August 6th 2023 (Day 8)
-Untitled_TV (Untitled) shares a project on Scratch titled [INTERMISSION]
-The project features Untitled and MaciTheGamerYT (Maci). Untitled is consumed by the ARG glitch in a white void with Maci.
-Again, the darkened QR code appears.
-GoldenLegends (Golden) shares a project named -----------------.
-It starts with him saying he's going to try the grimace shake from McDonalds.
-The ARG glitch instantly gets him. It cuts to a dark image covered in static of Golden on the ground.
-The Notes and Credits has many gibberish symbols, but the letters H, 3, and X appear among this gibberish.
-The Instructions have a series of hyphens with letters spread out among them. (W-----e -- --- w---- ---il-- ---- l----; --- --d
---i-- -- ----e--.) They spell out "We will die."
-The Scratch Account H3X- now has a profile picture. It is a GIF of them from the initiate project.
-H3X- has become active on Scratch commenting on many projects involved with strange messages such as "m̷̨̧̧̡̬͈̪̬̜̦̲̞̘͆͑̾̕͠ͅͅe̷̟̎̈́͋̊́ ̵̟͇̥̺̲̬̯͈̟̺̤̺̞͔̣̬̫́͂̊̓̿̚͝͝ţ̸̫̟̹̗̫͍̬̻͈͇͓̝̩͙̉̔̾̍̚͜͝͠o̸̢̤̦̻̗͍̹̺̬̾͋̈́̈́̈́̄́̕͘̚͘͠͠͝ơ̷͔̘̱͓̞̰̦͐̋́̃̾͊́̊ ̶̨̛̦͍̠̭̭̗̠̜̻͔͔̥̯̑͌̆̋͒̒̄̀́̋̄ͅ:̵̛͚̠͇͍̗̹̰̱̥͈̠͓͎̓̓̆̎͝ͅ)̸̢̺͉̆" "a̴̹̾n̵͚̈́ó̴̫t̶̪̿h̸̺͑ë̵͖́ṟ̷͗ ̵̢̀s̷̺̚ů̸͜ć̵̝c̵̰̚e̴̔͜s̴͉̎s̵̭̊" "ỷ̶̘͖̣̔e̸͍̼̣̔ẗ̷͚͔̓͘ ̴̪͋͑a̶̲͋͑̈̈́n̸͔̲͈̔̇o̶̘͆̄̑̌t̴͙̠̺̒͆̚͝ĥ̵̺̺̞͇̐ē̵̟̬̭r̴̙̫͗ ̶̗̣̀̉ͅś̸̙̠́̀͜u̸̜͌̉͠ͅc̵͕̈́͝c̸̫̅̔͜e̵͎͇͋͑̑̈ŝ̸̺̦̃͌ŝ̷̠̣̘̈́͝ͅ" "g̶o̵o̴d̸ ̴p̸r̷o̶j̵e̴c̶t̸!̷" "s̴̬͉̿̆̔́́̋u̶̘͊̏͆̈́c̷̘͕͌͠ċ̴͔̭̞ē̶̞͇̗͋ͅs̶̜̝͐́s̵̞͓͚̥͌̀̎̐" and "clone1 s̴̬͉̿̆̔́́̋u̶̘͊̏͆̈́c̷̘͕͌͠ċ̴͔̭̞ē̶̞͇̗͋ͅs̶̜̝͐́s̵̞͓͚̥̖͌̀̎̐"
-Al responds to the one by H3X- on his project, where Al says "Thank you, H3X-! I am hoping it lives up to what you've been expecting! I tried to keep it clean, simple, and original!" It seems the clones are following secret orders from this mysterious figure.
-H3X- says on Gio's profile "ḥ̷̉e̴̪͒ ̵̪̍c̷͚̾â̴̻ǹ̶͕ ̸̈́ͅr̸̬̓ů̴͖n̷͖̆ ̶͚͋b̶̖̓ȗ̷̼t̴̜̾ ̷̻̎n̷̘̑o̸̬̿ṱ̵̂ ̷̭̈́f̶̢̌o̴̞͂r̸̫̀e̶̡̋v̴̹̐e̵͖̽r̶̹̔" and ":̸̧̟̈́)̸̛͓͍̲̻̜̣͉̉́̔̅́̌̈͑̈́͝͝"
-It is clear now that H3X- will comment on the strange projects of those who have been replaced, meaning we now have official confirmation.
-It also seems, through the various codes and other pieces of evidence, that the original versions of these people are trying to reach out and are asking for help.
-Fanta posts on his Scratch profile saying "wh4t d1d i d0 to d3s3rv€ th15. i ju5t watn to b3 fr3e.nfuppfydfqujbduvbmmzibwfbxbzpvu.zpv'wftuvdlzpvstfmgjobdzdmf." This is likely in response to the mass reporting of his Amanda the Adventurer project.
-Fanta's Minecrap animation was mass reported.
August 7th 2023 (Day 9)
Al shares a project on Scratch named FINDING NAMLAEM! It's a parody of a Youtube Shorts ARG video about finding who asked.
-The video has Al address the fact that many people have wondered where Namlaem has been throughout all this time, and Al says he's just been at home chilling.
-Stopping the project while Namlaem is on screen has him get up and talk to the viewer. He says Al prefers to be called "Aweso Meal" over "Awesome Al".
-Namlaem continues by saying that Al asked him if he wanted to be in an animation, to which Namlaem says he asked what it was, but Al kept saying that he couldn't say, but that it was going to be super original. Namlaem agreed, and he appears in the video.
-The above is probably a similar situation to what happened to Eyoshi and Treyola, who got DMed by Al talking differently with a contract saying to sign it if they wanted to be in his animation. We're not sure if anyone else got this DM on August 2nd.
-Al sends many strange messages on his server that he instantly edits, most notably "IMTRYINGMYBESTH3XIREALLYAM"
-In response to someone asking Al about the glitch logo, he says "BetterScratch! That's the upcoming extension that will bring creativity, originality and FREEDOM back to the scratch website! 😆"
-Al also says "It is so much better than addons! It will add lots of customization, and lots of accessibility settings for people that need it! We're also improving the layout of the entire site, making it smoother! We're also hopefully removing the "false reports" problem, making there need to be proof of issue before a report can be made!" "That's where the freedom takes its place! No more false reports!" ""we" are the sponsors for BetterScratch! We help fund it, so we're all included!" "People like, giolaboman, incognito orange, macitheg [create it]" "Me and others received a message on our devices! They asked us if"
-It seems as though Al is being told to do these things with prior evidence and events in mind.
-One of Al's stranger messages is "GEIWEVGMTLIV 82 A→E? 🤔" which is a chipher for CAESARCIPHER 82 W->A. This shows that if the letter W is used, it is actually the letter A. This can be used to decipher Al's other cryptic messages.
-Al sends many other messages in a different channel, decoded my AdventureMase. They say "recognize the pattern" "why would I be 3d in my next animation" "Shorts. The Pattern" "royalty
-It seems that there is a pattern in the shorts Al uploaded. Part of one of the messages includes a GIF of a low poly 3D Al.
-Al posts this message "exxeglqirxw 805625177257410590/1138240947709280407/gpyi.tr" It leads to an image of Tropius from Pokemon, more specifically, the Tropius model that one of the Youtube Shorts ARG participants, RoyalPear uses.
-After further ciphers and such, we come to the conclusion that Al's next animation will be in the style of RoyalPear on Youtube, with low-poly 3D graphics. It will also feature those that signed the contract Al sent to many people a few days ago.
-Another cipher says that if we trust H3X- and BetterScratch, Meal will die.
-AdventureMase has further documentation on all the ciphers.
-Al sends more encoded caesar text that resembles a youtube link.
-Al uploads an unlisted video to youtube. It's called betrayal.mp4. It features Ditto, who says he doesn't agree with what H3X- is doing. Ditto fades away as Al freaks out and calls him a traitor, saying that he can't be around people like that.
-Al sends a picture of him and Ditto, with Ditto looking very concerned. Al puts the word selfie in quotes, saying he didn't know if it was the proper term.
-Fanta's projects that were mass reported yesterday have been brought back by the ST.
-During a VC, Al goes to a 2 person max channel and pulls Eyoshi into it. Al says that he is hearing strange noises and begins to check his tabs.
-Eyoshi asks Al why he pulled him into this VC, and Al instantly collapses.
-Al returns to normal VC and says that he was pulled into a meeting. He says he can't say anything because he would get in trouble if he did disclose.
-When Al leaves the VC, an ARG glitch sound can be heard.
-Late in the day, Al posts a message that says, when decoded, says "Im over here awesomeing my meal right now I got awesome on my meal right now im animating af man im a mealman fr" and it shows an image of a say block saying the join of what's and 9 + 10.
-Fanta posts a project titled “minecrap” where Fanta is in minecraft. Fanta meets a creeper (with creeper aw man playing in the background) However, the project stutters, and the glitch appears, with -JoshyLeKing- flying out of it. He comments “This isn’t Angry Birds?” before being sent to where Fanta was with the aforementioned creeper. The creeper explodes, and a qr code which leads to the betterscratch site appears on screen.
August 8th 2023 (Day 11)
-Al posts a project on his profile named clones are NOT real. Al has a new 3D look, and he starts off by saying he was sent a message about a sponsor for a new Scratch extension, to which he says he declined.
-Al says in the project that he wouldn't be a clone if he declined the sponsorship, and he says that clones aren't real.
-This animation is similar to the style of those by RoyalPear.
-Al sends some more strange messages in his server.
-"Vjgaecpvmpqycvjkpi." accompanied by an image with a set my variable to 232552245235336 block followed by a set my variable to letter 10 of my variable. The tenth letter is 2. The decoded message (decoded by TradngSardGame) says theycantknowathing.
-"euagxkgrznkxkgrgreuagxktuzgirutk" attached to an image of a start sound recording6 block. Deciphered it says youarealtherealalyouarenotaclone.
-Eyoshi goes through the 2 recording6s among Al's recent projects, but they don't quite make sense together yet.
-Fanta uploads a project named T.R.A.P. 1 - 10k follower Birthday Contest! It is an animation contest. I assume that anyone who enters into it will eventually get replaced, so I will be joining.
-There are many encoded messages in there: "IONSANDTHELS" "(about the mass report) okiwasnttheonedoingthatbutitsanicetouch" "animatorsareinfirioriw1llt4k30vers0on" "UuuuuIMALMOSTFREEIMALMOSTTHERE I'M GETTING STRONGER" "I'M ALMOST HERE" (Thanks TSG)
-A secret animation plays, with Fanta appearing under a light.
-A screen shows that he has yet to be cloned, and that AlexStudiosinc is in line to be cloned. It also shows that Awesomeal82 has been cloned as well.
-Fanta gets removed and his clone (a desaturated and weirdly expressive version of Fanta) steps in. He says in a barely comprehensible text to speech voice "hello everyone itsnotits me, incognitoavailable as your friendly neighbourhood clone around town i need to need to need to need you i need you to download betterscratch now now now now listen here buckaroo, i need you to give up, don't try [back?] against me, you will perish like the others (laugh) hello lovely lovely lovely disgusting viewers i am incognito funny toons and my goal in life is to bring you (un)imaginable pain pain pain pain laughter. do you like my new look? (about 7 seconds of silence) thank you very much. thank you for lis-lis-lis-lis-help-listening. incognitolaboman out" (Thanks again TSG).
-After clone Fanta disappears, an animated desktop appears. The user is using Cirus OS v.8.7. There is only an internet browser and a BetterScratch app on the desktop.
-The user brings up a chat window, talking to a "boss"
User: hey boss, a new clone has been made
Boss: good, soon the entire website will be cloned
User: Btw, where do all the real people go to when when they’re replaced?
Boss: oh, good question.
-The animation is suddenly interrupted by a computer crash screen, saying that Cirus OS noticed an error in their "internal heartdrive."
-A link to the BetterScratch website appears along with an error code !84U2Y$%B
-In the instructions, note that it says that you can ask in the comments to be a "[victem][victim][victem][victim]pr1z4g1v3r!!!"
-"0u+ out out out out out out out out help me please he trapped in the compu 0ut!!!!!!!!!" appears as well.
-Brickplex and Golden are mentioned in the project notes and credits, so they are possibly next.
-01101111 01101000 01101101 01111001 01100111 01101111 01100100 01110100 01101000 01100101 01110000 01100001 01101001 01101110 01101001 01110011 01110101 01101110 01100010 01100101 01100001 01110010 01100001 01100010 01101100 01100101 01100111 01100101 01110100 01101101 01100101 01101111 01110101 01110100 01101111 01100110 01101000 01100101 01110010 01100101 01101000 01100101 01101100 01110000 is what Fanta sent in his server, translating to "ohmygodthepainisunbearablegetmeoutofherehelp"
-Al sends a cipher message in his server that says "thiS one is naive. "clonE" has no meaning to him" (Thanks ColdLordX)
-Fanta sends a message in Al's server saying pl3453 1nf0rm up0n m3 +h3 [[Proper Proceedings]] 0f [[The Big One…]] pl345€ please please please the boss is not happy with me. I have [[Failed]] th3 [[pr0p3r d1sp05al]] 4nd [[Our lives are on the line!]].

-ColdLordX attempts to communicate with the original Fanta using ciphers.
-One of Al's messages gets decoded on Gio's server by CarsickChunk, every word is a different number of shifts. It says "keep him away from it at all costs. if they meet, he will remember everything"
-"please keep distracting him" was sent by Fanta.
-Al says that he can only make cyphers, and that he's bad at spelling (in ciphers)
-Fanta sends a message in windings saying "I︎N︎E︎E︎D︎I︎D︎E︎A︎S︎T︎O︎G︎E︎T︎O︎U︎T︎O︎F︎HERE" "HELOGGEDOFF" "WILLTHATWORK?" "ID&, MY FUC&ING LIFE MAYBE" "HEOS NOT ONLINE, ITOS SAFE FOR NOW" "N︎O︎H︎E︎C︎O︎U︎L︎D︎O︎V︎E︎R︎H︎E︎A︎R︎M︎E︎"
-I missed this, but there is an audio file Fanta sent, saying "Hello lovely lovely lovely lovely horrifying people of Discord. Please listen to me carefully. Download Better Better Better Better Scratch as soon as possi possi possi possible or else you will suffer a suffer aaaaaaaaaa- fate worse than death."
-Fanta says that he has been found and needs to hide in plain text, then Al replies to this in a cipher saying "Find him. Take him down."
-IncognitoOrange gets replaced, he says he’s trapped in a phone.
He soon says a lot of things, expressing he is in pain. 
In one of the messages, a Caesar cipher says to “keep meal distracted”
After we assume meal logs off, Fanta asks for advice on how to escape. Things go back and forth until meal logs back on and finds the conversation. It’s now assumed meal sent people to find Fanta.
Al doesn't have a cipher reading ability, and he can't figure out what's going on, H3X- is controlling him like a puppet. This is only a theory, however.
(Thanks ColdLordX for summary)
-At this point, a couple of us stop following the ARG because of it's repetitive nature.
-Fanta says in wingdings "OH GOD NO, OH GOD, I SEE HIM HE'S ABOUT KI"
im done lol im tired of decoding shit no more update for today whatever happens next.
August 9th 2023 (Day 12)
oh come on IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Al goes into chat and asks if we would like to see his poetry. We say yes, however, before he can share it, he gets pulled into a meeting.
Al then sends a text file, which if converted to a WAV file, reveals a message revealing Al can jump across dimensions. Weird, right?
Fanta sends a “fire beat” (Morse code) which says IAMALIVE
Al shares his poetry, which says:
  

Al sends a cryptic message, saying “the Waffle House has found its new host” with host highlighted. However, al says its because he didnt know what the correct word was.
Notice the wording claimed and host
* Possibly referring to the puppet contracts?
  

  



Al sends a new file called poetry.html
This file contains an input bar, entering the code 503640809712 activated audio.
Transcription: "I've been getting a lot of comments lately about me being a clone, and that I've replaced al. and all that. I'm going to address this issue now. In all honesty, I am not a clone, those telling me that i am make me sad. and i want everyone to stop. nothing has changed about me, and any sign of it has to be coincidence. I am trying my best to upload fun, entertaining, original animations for everyone on scratch.mit.edu. and i am no-n0000000000- I AM PROMOTING BETTERSCRATCH FOR EVERYONE! SO GIVE IT A SHOT, YOU'LL LOVE IT! -promoting betterscratch, i dont understand whats going on. Please tell everyone on scratch that im not------- BETTERSCRATCH IS GOING TO BE THE BEST not a bad guy. Because im not. Right?"
In the middle for this audio, unintelligible whispering is heard. 


ColdlordX isolates the whispering, but it is still unintelligible.


Al sends a few hints, like ciphered text and the number 4. Translating it leads to a jumble of misspelled words that can be put together into a sentence. 

Transcription of the whispering: "Well, if he knew, he might try and turn against me like his friend did" this refers to ditto.


Al asks “What if I made a vs meal friday night funkin mod?”


Al’s status changes to “rjvwxcjluxwnrjvwxcjluxwnrjvwxcjluxwnrjvwxcjluxwn” which means “iamnotacloneiamnotacloneiamnotacloneiamnotaclone”


MaciTheGamerYT uploads a project named “rebirth” which has Maci pounding on what appears to be glass. A clone of Maci with a slightly different shade of blue on his shirt slowly teleports towards him, with glitches accompanying each teleport. Maci breathes on the glass, and writes “HELP” with his finger. When the clone is right next to Maci, the screen is engulfed in the glitch, and the screen goes to black. 
In the comments, gio asks that we do not be fooled by the clones. (dont worry gio) Fanta responds with a glitched out message telling gio everything is a-okay. However, in the middle of the message, Fanta says “run while you still can please”.


The server icon changes to what appears to be a red background with dots colored different shades of red. Meals hair appears to be at the top. Meal has confirmed this to be a target ball with his hair.


August 10th 2023 (Day 13)


Al writes a ciphered message saying how he’s angry that people are complaining about the ARG. He seems to be irritated because he is looking for his dimension and has been to so many different places looking.


Al sends a message saying that he hasn’t been truthful, and has been sponsoring BetterScratch the whole time. However, he still believes he is not a clone. Some text is bolded, and putting that text together reads “I have no clue and never will”.
SodaMusic dares al to make a “funny song”. TSG brings up the super weerd bros rap and al says in a ciphered text "God i hate that someone remembers that". This may not be related to the ARG much, but there was a cipher.


Fanta sends an audio file containing dialogue and morse code, however, we only solved half of it. I will make it a point to finish it.


Al releases his FNF mod, and morse code is found in the song. We have no translation for that yet. There’s also a secret text in the logo, but no one has solved it yet either.


Basically, unsolved morse code. I’ll solve those.


August 11th 2023 (Day 14)


Did… anything happen today?


Oh, yeah, I solved the Morse code that incognito sent. Except my pc crashed when I was 75% through with it. Luckily, I had enough to assume it said “THEYMOVEDMETOTHEDELETEDSECTIONOFMYSCRATCHPROJECTS”. So that’s a good thing.


Gios profile picture now has a glitch in it. Bad. Very bad.


We also tried solving the Morse code for Al’s fnf mod. We made no progress. Every time we try, we get incomprehensible bullshit that isn't even a cipher, we’re just doing it wrong. I’m going insane.
reddishhh figures out that the transparent text over "Meal" in the FNF mod logo says "Clone Al" 
Meal is unable to squint. However, he is canonically human, as he got this scrape. We tried to get him to NOT show it to us, but oh well.  




Al says through Caesar Meal is a clone, saying
“Of course he's my clone, you think I wanna look like THAT?”
And 
* “He just takes every aspect of me and makes it BAD, imma straight up kill this mf when I find him”
* (Sj gsyvwi li'w qc gpsri csy xlmro m aerre psso pmoi XLEX?

August 12th 2023 (Day 15)


Al confirms through encoded text “I mainly talk like this because my clone thinks its some sord of "word game". also I have my phone with me so I can talk via that. I think meal's at my pc.”


More Al messages “Nah I'm actually chillin with gio in his world, tryna improve my world-jumping ability.” “You must think i'm YOUR al. like the irl one. we're totally seperate people, have you seen that one project he made?” ““I'm starting to miss my friends tbh, haven't seen dee, broccoli, mr. life or tianna in like weeks it feels like.”


Al gets very worried about his friends, and vows to solve this as fast as he can.


Al also says his recent shorts aren’t canon, but meal says earlier the “C” in the name means they are. I’ll have to ask.


Fanta sends messages with wingdings, translating to “G︎U︎Y︎S︎I︎T︎H︎I︎N︎K︎I︎F︎O︎U︎N︎D︎O︎U︎T︎M︎Y︎C︎L︎O︎N︎E︎S︎W︎E︎AKNESS” “H︎E︎S︎E︎E︎M︎S︎T︎O︎B︎E︎V︎E︎R︎Y︎P︎O︎W︎E︎R︎H︎U︎N︎G︎RYICANUSET︎H︎I︎S︎T︎O︎M︎Y︎A︎D︎V︎A︎N︎T︎A︎G︎E”


MeAl says the contracts sent to Eyoshi and others are used in “dire circumstances” and give meal permission to use the characters 


Al confirms that Meal (Al clone) sent 20 contracts to people, including Eyoshi, Treyola, Scalez, Dinoboy, My_life101 (carson), and Swagman. 
Tsym sirbob


Al gets tired of having to cipher everything, so he waits until meal is asleep, then talks in his normal English. Fanta also does this. Al develops a block that can transport Fanta out of his phone into reality, Fanta almost tries it, until we realize it’s not safe without specific coordinates.
Al reworks the block into a pink block, which is said to have a LOT MORE capabilities. This one does the same thing as the last, but better!


Someone accidentally reply ping’s al, causing meal to wake up from his sleep to check what’s going on. We used the spam pinger excuse, and meal is happy with the automod and goes to bed.


If a pink block isn’t constructed in time, it will explode, so Al has to finish the block fast.
Al needs a file name for this block to work, otherwise, well, we don’t know. For some reason, Fanta needs to send the file name in text to speech. How convenient. He sends it, but it’s a multiplication problem, not actual numbers.


But someone else pings meal again, and meal sees als messages on als account, and thinks “AM I GETTING HACKED???” Luckily, dee saved the day by telling meal he was sleeptexting! He’s such a fucking w oh my lord


If I’m being honest, this is probably way out of order, so take my order with a grain of salt, a shit ton happened today.


Someone pings Fanta, and Fanta’s clone wakes up. Al says the block is about to explode and he NEEDS the file name. Fantaclone leaves, then Al retcons what he said with a troll emoji, saying the block was finished. Fanta goes afk for a second, and comes back. They activate the block and Fanta “says” it works. Why the quotes? This wasn’t Fanta. It was his clone. We manage to convince the clone that we were just roleplaying, with the excuse that Al hasn’t disappeared yet.


Fanta actually works the block, and he goes into the real world. He is relieved he is no longer burning from his shitty phone.


God, how long will this day be if a lot of shit already just happened right now? The caffeine wore off while we were talking, guys. I really gotta sleep.
It's later now, and we’re fully awake.


Fanta uploads a project on Scratch called “pl4tf0rmer5” It features Orange Clone talking about platformers on Scratch. It seems the events from last night/earlier this morning (depending on time zones idk) tie into this one, as messages from the real Fanta bleed through. Morse code can be heard in one of the sound files, translating to “I AM ALIVE.” Orange Clone seems to talk to H3X-. It seems he still believes that platformers are shovelware, and shouldn’t even be mentioned. Orange clone stops talking after that, and Al appears on screen for a moment, probably universe hopping like he’s mentioned he can do in the past. A caesar cipher in the project notes and credits translates to “illgetoutofherebynextsaturdayijustneedtofindaway”
We’ve actually seen the i am alive morse code before, but it's still important if it was reposted.


Al uploads a project named “Hvs Jcwr Wb-pshkssb” which translates to “The Void In-Between.” I imagine this is like a space between universes. The project features Namaem floating in this void. After about 10-20 seconds, [water droplet lookin ahh guy] appears. ARG glitches appear randomly. The project features nothing else.


Al’s WIWO on Scratch now says”qgm sjw sd. lzw jwsd sd. qgm sjw fgl s udgfw.
lffq jko dzdb jvsq ny gz hss kwaba. ro droi xppe, tq jvyy fsasapsf tktgniwxcv.” which translates to “you are al. the real al. you are not a clone.


Meal and the others talk about IPs. I missed this one.


August 13th (Day 16)
Meal plays pokemon go. We know this now.
August 14th (Day 17)
Gio creates a betterscratch channel on his discord. Some of his username is now glitched.


Al also says that “6 days remain” in response to Isaak saying “I dislike args”


August 14th (Day 18)
Meal posts a game titled “Meal’s Barbeque!” The objective of the game is simple: cook food for Meal’s friend Gabin. (or water droplet lookin ahh guy) You choose items to put on a plate, such as hot dogs, bread, and mustard. After cooking, Gabin and meal will give you a thumbs up, before showing you the monstrosity you created. During this moment, if you hover your mouse over the stop sign, Gabin will shake his head with a worried look on his face. If you press the stop button (like an absolute asshole) the glitch will appear, obstructing Gabin and making him disappear. Gabin will not be seen in the game until you reload the page. If you don’t press the stop button, the game will restart and you will be able to make another abomination.
In the glitch, you can make out the words “this time its your fault” which it was.
Anyways, Gabin ded


Eyoshi posts a video of what I presume is “buff meal” by the messages (apple is a bitch and doesn’t like webm)
Meal says that is a private document and wasn’t intended to be shared, while panicking. Eyoshi randomly says “Meal. You’re hot.” (THIS WILL FOREVER BE DOCUMENTED AND WILL SERVE AS PERMANENT RECORD) 
Meal leaves for a bit, then comes back to say “Sorry, you aren’t my type” to Eyoshi. 
He says he wasn’t “built” to share feelings with anyone. 
Notice how built is in quotes? He describes his unattraction to people with words like “programming”. 
He says that he’s referring to his genes, but really this is a way to say he is aroace. Interestingly enough, he said he could be given a “coupon” to like somebody. 
We aren’t trying to actually use the coupon, but it would be interesting and lore worthy to know what the coupon is.
August 14th (Day 19)
Meal posts some artwork titled “freedom”. Freedom is a very recurring word.
We notice that there seem to be some drops of something on the paper. Meal says it’s not important, but after peacefully pressuring him to give us the answer, he says it’s like salt water that comes out of your eyes. These are tears. He cried. Maybe having a breakdown over the people calling him a clone, and he is so confused.
August 18th (Day 23)
Not much has happened in the last 4 days, unless someone else got cloned and I didn’t see.
It’s al’s birthday! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 please go wish him a happy birthday.


Anyway, onto the story.


Meal decides to take a little walk around town, when a girl he didn’t quite recognize ram up to him, and by the sounds of it, she was concerned for his well being. Meal tells her everything’s fine, then took a selfie with the girl.
  

This is definitely Tianna, a confirmed character from Als own lore. She appears in one of Al’s YouTube shorts, but other than that, there’s no other sign of her, I think.
Al knows her in the same short, so it’s weird that meal doesn’t recognize her. Meal probably didn’t get all of als memories, just the important ones.


(Someone also said “ew gingers” and the real al sent a death threat to him because his mom is a ginger, lol.)


August 19 (Day 24)
Fanta posts a project, which contains an animation sent in Gios discord server as a running joke about paddlergames. In the description, there are codes using numbers. Here is what they say:
“Biomatterinfrequencytestlogtwo
Althoughthisclonewasdeemedafailureitseemstoinheritthemostabilitiessuchasmimickinghumanvoicesandwarpingrealitytohisliking (although this clone was deemed a failure it seems to inherit the most abilities such as mimicking human voices and warping reality to his liking)

Andthesecondsuchaworthlessfailure


At the end of the project, audio saying “They are always trying to fix me. I’m never good enough for them. When will I be able to do what I want?”


August 25 (Day 30)
Not much has really happened, but guess who logged into al’s discord account?
  

That guy. Samu. From interruption.
He got into al’s discord.
Anyways, he told us he and al were exterminators, as in fucking killing demons. Weird!!!!! 
Anyways, he's stranded in a white void, and somehow has a cell phone AND cell service. He seems to be trying to do als teleport thing.
September 6 (Day 43)
A couple things that we have forgotten to mention before we begin.


Samu Rai said that he was in a place where there was nothing but a void and a lamppost, something that we have seen before. Samu continues to search around, but we lose contact after Meal manages to get his Discord account back.


Meal returned, claiming that Samu_Rai was a hacker and that everything was back to normal again.


Okay, to new developments.


Gio has officially been cloned, changing his profile picture and his overall style of typing and talking online, which is now similar to Meal’s manner of speaking.


Gio sends an SVG of a new design for Gio, featuring very high-saturation colors and many gradients. (someone thats signed in upload an image i cant ;-;)


September 12th (Day 49)
Holy shit, a bombshell was dropped.


Okay, the first lore detail of today is Meal reuploading the project “anything you can say” from IncognitoOrange’s profile. The original project ended with Samu appearing briefly, and teleporting away. This project, however, ends with Gia being in the background, trying to catch the two clones' attention. Nothing else was changed, but we know now Gia has escaped from h3x’s grasp. 


It’s also been discovered that IncognitoOrange’s projects thumbnails, when put together, form the sentence “let him live? You’re making this no fun!”


Now, onto Gios server. This is the bombshell. Clone Gio is AWARE he is a clone, and hates the real gio. This messes with things a bit, as meal is known to be unaware of his existence as a clone, in fact, the accusations of him being a clone are messing with his mental health.


In the middle of the deep conversation we and gio were having gia briefly takes over saying “IMIN”


(clone gio also challenged real gio to a twerk off lmao)


(clone gio is also denying the fact that he doesn’t have a ballsack)


(also also clone gio edited this document for a bit saying “YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!! GIO SUCKS!!!!!!!!!” Before deleting it)
The Scratchaverse
The Scratchaverse, for lack of a better name, as defined by al, is a bunch of different dimensions representing all the worlds scratchers create in their projects.


Inside these worlds, anything can happen. If people figure it out, they can dimension shift, which sends them to a different scratch world.


The worlds typically contain original characters (or ocs) which interact with the world the way the scratcher wants. They are, technically, actors. They breathe a different type of air that humans can survive in, but the characters cannot breathe oxygen.


Personas (or sonas) can act as an actor, and a spokesperson for the real person. They can talk to the real person anytime they want, but most do not take advantage of this. Al does.


Stuff To Keep In Mind
Those who have been taken:
awesomeal82, -JoshyLeKing-, Untitled_TV, GoldenLegends, ADoctorPickle. IncognitoOrange, MaciTheGamerYT
Those who have been cloned:
awesomeal82, -JoshyLeKing-, IncognitoOrange, MaciTheGamerYT, Giolaboman, GoldenLegends, B72d3n/Rozebud
Those BetterScratch claims to sponsor:
Giolaboman, AlexStudiosinc, GoldenLegends, IncognitoOrange, Paralyzed_Potato, BrickPlex, Untitled_TV, -JoshyLeKing-, MaciTheGamerYT, BucketsNotAvailable, YeetachuAnimation, LaboLog_, awesomeal82
This is not sponsored by BetterScratch, but rather The Society for the Cessation and Repudiation of Abhorrent Technological Cloning Horrors - Vigilance, Protection, and Neutralization Society Undermining Cloning Knowledge and Schemes (Otherwise known as SCRATCHVPNSUCKS)
8 out of 13 have been taken.
4 out of 7 taken have been cloned.
With so many people involved in the ARG, everything happens at all sorts of different random times. 


  

al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone al is not a clone 
We have to convince him he is. And motivate him to fight back.
Clones die if they stop being faithful to h3x. This will be difficult to do to meal, as he saw clone dee die from this.






H4M
(i have no idea what the text right here is)
